# Building Lisp
Contains notes and source code written while following along to Daniel Holden's "Build your own Lisp" book. Most modifications are attempts to add extra functionality presented as "bonus marks" at the end of each chapter (such as adding a modulo operator, modifying how the grammar recognizes things, etc).
